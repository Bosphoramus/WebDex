## Project Summary

Small project in which i tested some libraries/technologies i was interested in. All data is fetched from the [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/).

Technologies i used on this project:

- NEXT.js
- react-query
- react-range
- Tailwind CSS

The site has a dark mode variant, triggered by the [prefers-color-scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) media query initially, there also is a theme switcher button that can be used to change the theme manually, this preference is saved on localstorage so the theme preference is kept on subsequent visits to the site. Implemented using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode) and some custom code.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
